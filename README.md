This repository contains code for our project, "Classifying Urban Land in Indonesia Using Convolutional Neural Networks." In this project, we use a novel dataset of 1,424 satellite images to classify urban land in Cirebon, Indonesia using three deep learning algorithms: CNN, VGG16, and EfficientNetV2.

Please refer to our full report and presentation for a discussion of the results.
